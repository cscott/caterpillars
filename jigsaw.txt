like Entanglement on the bottom.  Automated search for such puzzles?
That one is 16x16 pixels with 8 pieces.
Maybe make voids form a letter or word?
Constraint that pieces must all be "thin" (ie, one pixel wide)
Constrain pixels on/off to form letters, and then form letters by
tracing.
Recursive/backtracking.  Decide whether next pixel is on/off (search
off first, or flip coin to get desired % void) and then decide whether
to turn nesw.  Forbid self-intersection (should be easy) and moving
adjacent to pixel already in piece (last piece excluded)
